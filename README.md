To do:
- A metric unit settings at the top based on your country - with 2 options (metric or imperial). 


## My Thoughts
I enjoyed this project creating a web application similar to bbc weather website and understanding the variety of applications that can be created using code. I learnt how to render a website with live api data using Express, JSON and EJS.
