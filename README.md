# Weather-App

I created a weather app that shows you the current temperature and weather conditions for a country or city. I used HTML, CSS, node.js, express, EJS and a weather API to create this app. 

# How-To-Navigate

The user has to input the country or city in the text and click go and the app will tell you the current weather condition. 

You also need to set the metric unit at the top based on your country - with 2 options (metric or imperial).
