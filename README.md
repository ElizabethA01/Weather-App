## My Thoughts
I really enjoyed recreating the game Simon, as I enjoy gaming. It was appealing and enjoyable to build the game from scratch and JS, HTML and CSS interact with each other to produce a web app. I learnt how to use the JavaScript jQuery to manipulate the HTML and the ease of use when creating websites.
